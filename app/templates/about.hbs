		Redditvid is a lighweight reddit client, that regurgitates <a href="www.reddit.com/r/videos">www.reddit.com/r/videos</a> in a responsive form. It's made using ember.js cli and hosted on node.js. 
		I created it to better understand ember, use ouath and experiment with svg transitions. 
		Currently it's possible to:			
		<ul>
			<li>List the top 25 trending vidoes</li>
			<li>Login to reddit using oauth</li>
			<li>Upvote or downvote a video</li>
			<li>View any of these videos, and view top level comments</li>
			<li>Leave a comment</li>
		</ul>
