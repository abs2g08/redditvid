# Redditvid

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM) and [Bower](http://bower.io/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running

Due to Reddit's lack of CORS support for its API. All requests have to be proxied through a node.js server located in /node_server.

You can run it using `ember server`, but loggin in won't work.

Proper way:

* `./run.sh`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:5000.

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying

If you have pulled this branch from openshift, deploying is as simple as `git push origin master`.
